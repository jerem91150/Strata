    // **WHAT A CHUNK BUYS IS THE EXPERT'S BYTES READ ONCE FOR EVERY TOKEN THAT ROUTED TO IT.**  One token reads
    // its 8 experts a layer: 3.82 GiB over the trunk, and the pool is bound by that read (measured 101.9 ms of
    // a 229.5 ms token on four cards, against 3.82 GiB of host memory at ~37 GB/s).  A chunk of C tokens reads
    // only the DISTINCT experts the chunk routed to - measured off a 516-token router trace: 5.6x fewer bytes a
    // token at C=128.  The FLOPs do not change; every token still dots against its own experts.
    //
    // The grouping is what makes that true, and it is a counting sort, not a sort of the pairs: `head_[e]` holds
    // the first pair routed to expert `e` and `next_` chains the rest, so `nt * k` pairs are bucketed in one
    // pass over the ids.  Each bucket is then cut into jobs of at most `MAXT` tokens - `ExpertJobMulti` carries
    // one activation and one output row per token, and `MAXT` is where that array ends.  A hot expert (one the
    // chunk routed to more than `MAXT` times) becomes several jobs over the SAME slices, and
    // `run_split_multi_native` batches whatever comes out at its own `kMaxSplitMulti`.
    //
    // **THE SLICES DO NOT COST THE GROUP ITS KERNEL - AND THEY MUST NOT.**  `native_rows_sliceable` answers "no"
    // at `nt > 1` for this pack's IQ3_S gate/up, which reads as "assemble a blob or take the per-token dot".
    // Neither is necessary: the multi-token kernel addresses the up row as `blob + up_off + r * gu_row`, so two
    // slices out of one mapping ARE a blob with `up_off = up - gate`, and `native_gu_rows_slice` hands them over
    // as one.  That matters because the per-token dot re-decodes every row for EVERY token of the group, and the
    // decode - not the read - is what the pool spends its time on: measured here, `--prefill 128` read 4.5x
    // fewer expert bytes than `--prefill 1` (1245.3 -> 276.6 GiB) and the pool took the same 30.4 s until the
    // group reached the multi-token kernel, which took it to 12.9 s.  The ~3e-8 the kernel rounds differently
